              My love,<br/>
                    My team and I have discovered a strange asteroid field out in the depths of the Third System.<br/>
                    On every asteroid in the field is a portal to another asteroid.<br/>
                    The mining oppurtunities here are endless.<br/>
                    We can only manage to run 5 factories on each asteroid, any more and it becomes unstable.<br/>
                    However, an enemy of the state has also come across this field.<br/>
                    The government has ordered me to produce robotic tanks in my mining factories to help destroy the enemy.<br/>
                    But the nearest government agent is lightyears away, so it is up to me to defeat the enemy and gain control for the government.<br/>
